#  Netflix Data Analysis & Visualization – ML Project

A machine learning and data analysis project that explores the Netflix dataset to uncover content trends, perform data cleaning, and visualize meaningful patterns in streaming media.

---

##  Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes the Netflix dataset to extract actionable insights using Python. It includes **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **visualizations** to understand content distribution by type, country, genre, and release timeline.

###  Key Objectives:
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Analyze the distribution of Netflix content (Movies vs TV Shows)
- Identify content trends by country, release year, and ratings
- Visualize top genres, directors, and frequently appearing cast members
- Answer specific business-oriented queries using code and visual analysis

##  Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle – Netflix Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
- **File**: `netflix_titles.csv`
- ⚠ *Dataset is not included in this repository due to redistribution restrictions.*
-  Download manually from the link above and place it in your project folder to run the notebook.

##  Techniques & Features Used

-  Data Cleaning (handling nulls, duplicates, format issues)
-  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-  Grouping, filtering, and cross-analysis by multiple columns
-  Visualization using:
  - `Seaborn`
  - `Matplotlib`
-  Insightful Question-Answering (e.g., most active countries, popular genres)

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment**: Google Colab  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

##  Sample Insights

-  TV Shows dominate recent additions compared to Movies.
-  The United States and India are the top content providers.
-  Peak content additions occurred between 2017–2019.
-  "Documentaries" and "Dramas" are the most frequent genres.

##  How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows).
3. Place `netflix_titles.csv` in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Open `netflix_Ml_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
5. Run all cells to reproduce the results.
